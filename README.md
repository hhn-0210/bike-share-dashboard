## Recommendation
### Conservative price increase
Considering and substantial 25% in price increase last year, a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range or 10-15% in price could test the market without risking a significant loss to customers

### Price setting:
If the price in 2022 was $4.99, a 10% increase would make the new price $5.49 and a 15% increase would make it $5.74

### Recommended strategy: 
__Market analysis__: Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes, overall economic environment. This can guide weather leaning towards lower or higher end of suggested price increase.

__Segmented pricing strategy__: Consider different pricing for casual vs registered users, as they might have different price sensitivity.

__Monitor and adjust__: implement new prices but be ready based on immediate feedback and sales data. Monitor closely will allow you to fine tune your pricing startegy without committing fully to a price that might turn out too high.
